# Typography
Typography plays a crucial role in user experience design by shaping the way information is communicated and perceived, thus impacting the overall usability and appeal of a product or interface.

## Headings
Headings in typography are a hierarchical system of organizing content that provide visual cues and improve scannability and navigation for the reader.

Text can be styled as a heading using the `h1-h6` HTML tags and `.h1-.h6` CSS classes.
