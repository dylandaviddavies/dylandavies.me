# Spacing
Proper spacing is essential in user experience web design, as it enhances readability, improves visual balance and hierarchy, and provides breathing space that improves user comprehension and engagement with content.

Padding and margin CSS utility classes are provided and follow the below format:

`pl-1` `pr-2` `m-2` `mt-5`

`{unit}{direction?}-{amount}`

## Margin
<Canvas>
  <Story of={SpacingStories.Margin} />
</Canvas>

## Padding
<Canvas>
  <Story of={SpacingStories.Padding} />
</Canvas>
