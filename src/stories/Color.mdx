# Color
Color is a critical component in user experience web design, as it influences user perception and emotion, aids in content organization, and helps to establish brand identity and recognition.

## Text
Colors can be applied to text using the `.text-*` CSS utility classes.
<Canvas>
  <Story of={ColorStories.Text} />
</Canvas>

## Backgrounds
Background colors can be applied using the `.bg-*` CSS utility classes.
<Canvas>
  <Story of={ColorStories.Backgrounds} />
</Canvas>

## Theme
Themes can be applied using the `.theme-*` CSS utility classes. Themes are color palettes, each color having its own specific function.

The theme CSS class will define CSS variables on its element that then can be used within its scope.

For example: `background: var(--dd-background)` apply a background color using theme's background color.
<Canvas>
  <Story of={ColorStories.Theme} />
</Canvas>
