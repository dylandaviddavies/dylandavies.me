# Button
Buttons allow users to trigger an action or event with a single click. For example, you can use a button for submitting a form, opening a dialog, or opening a link.

<Meta title="Documentation/Button" />

<Canvas>
    <Story of={ButtonStories.Basic} />
</Canvas>

## Variations
There can be more than one button in a screen, so we need to create the hierarchy of actions using different button variations.

### Kinds

<Canvas>
    <Story of={ButtonStories.Kinds} />
</Canvas>

### Animations
Buttons can have a variety of hover animations with their own custom content.

#### Directional
<Canvas>
    <Story of={ButtonStories.DirectionalAnimations} />
</Canvas>

#### Custom Content
<Canvas>
    <Story of={ButtonStories.CustomContentAnimations} />
</Canvas>
